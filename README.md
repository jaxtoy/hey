    🟢 = You can talk to me
  
  ⛔ = May be busy or not in the mood to talk 
  🌙 = offtab/busy 
  
  I like C+H but most of the time I'm with friends and I'm too shy to approach others. 
  
  I have cover discomfort please don't cover me, otherwise anything is fine.
  
  You'll always find me around the TADC/Glitch Productions area, if not then idk what I'm doing
